EnviroGuard:-

Address the growing need for continuous environmental monitoring within indoor spaces.

Track air quality, temperature, humidity, and motion detection, which are crucial parameters for maintaining a healthy and safe living environment.

Employs three primary sensors - MQ135 air quality sensor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, and FC-51 IR motion sensor that interfaced with ESP8266 microcontroller to collect environmental data. 

Future work:-

Implementation of advanced data analytics through machine learning algorithms - predict environmental trends and provide actionable insights.

Development of a mobile application would greatly enhance accessibility - allowing users to remotely monitor environmental data and receive alerts on their mobile devices.
